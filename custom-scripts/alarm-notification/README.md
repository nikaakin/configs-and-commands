## üì¶ Prerequisites

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Linux

- [`at`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/at) ‚Äî used to schedule a future job
- [`notify-send`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/notify-send.1.en) ‚Äî sends popup notifications
- [`aplay`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/aplay) ‚Äî plays `.wav` audio files

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è macOS

- `sleep` and backgrounding `(& disown)` ‚Äî used instead of at to delay and detach jobs.
- `terminal-notifier` ‚Äî replacement for notify-send, used to show macOS-native notifications.
- `afplay` ‚Äî built-in macOS command-line audio player (used instead of aplay).

## Examples:

- Alarm will be up in 1 minute : `alarm-notification 1`.
- View all prepared notification by : `atq`. Which will show something like this : `48	Sun Sep 17 21:46:00 2023 a user` meaning there is one notification which will be fired at the time specified there.
- If you wish to remove the specific notification `atrm <id>`. id in our case is `48` from here `48	Sun Sep 17 21:46:00 2023 a user`.

## Usage On Different Platforms

- `alarm-notification` file includes scripts for both Linux and macOS. Comment out the one you don't need.

## Limitations

- On Mac custom notification image wont work. To make it work user -sender option on terminal-notifier command. -sender should be an application bundle identifier.
